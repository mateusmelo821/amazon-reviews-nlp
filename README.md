# amazon-reviews-nlp

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing information about amazon reviews, such as the review text and its category. The data was loaded from an AWS S3 bucket. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, spacy, json and boto3), Jupyter notebooks, machine learning and classification algorithms, natural language processing, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/amazon-reviews-nlp/index.html).
